-------Problem Statement-------
    The problems faced by students are
        1)Finding other students with common academic or extracurricular interests. 
        2)Lack of proper guidance
        3)Clarification of doubt when one is learning something new.
    By connecting with other people with common interests you will have better support systems who know what you are 
    going through and can share their trials and victories with you. Also when a student first enters a college it's 
    difficult for him/her to find suitable on-campus clubs. So, it is necessary to have an application that addresses 
    this need by which students can connect with others easily and work and learn together. 

    This can be addressed by creating a software where a student can register themselves and login. There will be 
    various groups available here like hobbies, sports and fitness, technology, programming, competitive exams etc., 
    The student can find his area of interest and join in that particular group. The student can add himself in the group 
    and can collaborate with others. This also provides an option for a student to form groups internally and work.
